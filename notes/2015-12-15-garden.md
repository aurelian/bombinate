### Garden

First step in making bombinate look *awesome* was to get some sort of CSS stuff going.

With my background, integrating SCSS was a natural move, but I soon realised the current implementations for SCSS in Clojure are relying on either having an SCSS compiler installed on your box like [lein-scss](https://github.com/bluegray/lein-scss) does or binding into the ruby implementation via jruby like [sass-clojure](https://github.com/mylesmegyesi/sass-clojure) does. Nothing wrong with those approaches, but for this project I wanted to have everything as much as possible self contained.

And then I found [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden) where rules and declarations are treated as data thus having the power of a programming language at your finger tips just to render CSS.

Was easy to set it up: added it as a dependency on ```project.clj```, pushed some codes into the ```bombinate.styles.app``` namespace and then integrated with [lein-garden](https://github.com/noprompt/lein-garden#preface) to compile and dump the output to ```resources/public/css/style.css``` so *figwheel* can pick it up.

Right. At this point my workflow is *figwheel* running in a console and ```lein garden auto``` in another, so when I change the CSS generated by *Garden* it gets compiled and then *figwheel* will update it on the browser.

This is far from being optimal. In a perfect world I would like to have only one console with *figwheel* and not having to remember to start some other *lein* task every time I change something in the CSS.

This is a very insightful presentation given by Priyatam Mudivarti at Clojure / West 2015.

There are a few interesting points there. One is about a grid system which I definitely need to checkout next. But my takeaway was to store the styles in ```app-state``` atom and then have each component style itself on *mount* (he's using *Om* but same applies for *reagent*).
**Nice trick**. Obviously there's no need for an intermediary step to output the CSS to some file because you'll end up with the CSS as a javascript function.

For my PHP brain this idea is mind-blowing and I totally understand the value it adds, but somehow I want to keep looking for alternatives. An idea that I would like to pursue in the future is to [script figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel#scripting-with-component) and create a specific *figwheel* component for *Garden* using [css-watcher](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/tree/master/sidecar#adding-the-css-watcher-component) as a starting point.
